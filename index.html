      <h2>My Dearest Akka🤎</h2>
      <p>You spoke with sweet laughter and a charming affection. 
          Your words are like stars, twinkling brightly and sparkling in the sky.</p>
      <p>I won’t ask for your address, because I know your smile is your home.</p>
      <p>You look like a beautiful flower. I wonder, can a flower speak? 
          But I realized that when your words blossom, it becomes a lovely spring.</p>
      <p>In your playful eyes, I found a dream of becoming a brave woman. Don’t hide your dreams and worries behind your beautiful smile, Let them bloom; make your dreams come true, as pretty as you are.
        I really miss you, Akka. </p>
      <p>But I wonder — how can I miss my heart, liver, or kidney?
        Ok, whatever (hehehe). Thank you for your guidance, support, and encouragement.</p>



        
      <p>Forever yours,<br> Pujitha</p>
